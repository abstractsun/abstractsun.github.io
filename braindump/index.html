braindump is a collection of notetaking scripts run from the command line. Downloads, source code, and documentation are [here](https://github.com/abstractsun/braindump). -- [abstractsun](../)

# Why

I had a problem which could be best summed up as, "too many notes".

Some notes were just, all over the place: Stored in random files, stored in email/instant messaging, et cetra. Notes fortunate to have a home were poorly organized. To a certain extent, this was a lack of discipline on my part which improved over time. But even with the best of intentions, stuff would get lost.

I also have random thoughts a lot, and these need to go somewhere.

Some of these issues could be addressed by a better file naming system. I also needed better organization within the files themselves.

# What I tried

I have tried numerous tools, most notably a text editor by itself, [Fossil](https://fossil-scm.org/)'s issue tracker, [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/), and [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/). I do still use all of these certain situations (in particular, (this site is currently running using [my personal fork of Markdeep](../cmd/)). However, they fell short for one or more of these reasons:

- Too high upfront cost to creating notes. I didn't want to have to think about what to name a file, what metadata to add, or what org mode syntax to use.
- Too many distractions when creating the note, such as the contents of other notes, or the distracting visual clutter of org mode syntax.
- Too many limitations/too rigid (again... looking at you, org mode)
- The issue that I write something down and forget that it exists.
- I just like [vim](https://www.vim.org/) better! In particular, I prefer a vanilla-ish vim setup (Huge version without GUI, a few lightweight plugins). In my opinion, vim folds are nicer than org mode headings.

# How it works

[shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) are the secret sauce to [braindump](https://github.com/abstractsun/braindump). They make it easy to execute the commands from the same folder. To illustrate, one could type `ls` in the braindump root directory, and get the following files and folders:

```
$ ls
idea   log   note   pin  queue   scratch  tag   tasks  triage
ideas  logs  notes  qr   remind  sync     task  todo
```

`./note` just opens vim to a timestamped file and moves my cursor to the bottom of the file. I write the note and then quit vim.

The shebangs work inside vim, too, allowing for some nice synergies, for example:

```vim
:split `./queue ?`
:term mv -iv `./task weekend ?` tasks/archived
:!./qr
:!./remind parse
```

As for the implementation, it's lots of bash hackery, and calls to external unixy tools.

Overall, braindump works for me, because:

- Much less overhead to open a file in my text editor of choice
- `./triage` conditionally guarantees my more disorganized, random notes get reviewed eventually, provided that I have the discipline to run the command, and the discipline to not create more randomness than I can review.
- No unnecessary upfront structure
- Syncs with git!
