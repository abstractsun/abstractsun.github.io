[abstractsun](../): On this page, I list various tools and techniques *roughly* related to "personal knowledge management" (pkm), notetaking, task management, and time management that I either personally use, OR I could see myself using if my needs were different.

The name is a reference to the "awesome" lists found on code forges.
